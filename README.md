# Plantasia

## 🌿 Project goal

Plantasia is an online store dedicated to selling plants and accessories for their care. The main goal of the project is to provide a simple and intuitive shopping experience, where users can explore different plant categories and find relevant information about each one. Additionally, it aims to promote a love for gardening and plant care in both indoor and outdoor spaces.

## 💡 Motivation

The idea for Plantasia stems from the growing trend of integrating nature into homes and workspaces. My goal was to create an accessible and visually appealing platform for plant lovers, from beginners to experts. The project was developed as part of my learning process in React and modern web development technologies, combining intuitive design with interactive functionality.

## 🛠️ Tools

For the development of Plantasia, I used the following tools and technologies:

- React.js: To build the user interface and component structure.

- Vite: As a fast and optimized development environment.

- Bootstrap: For layout design and predefined styles.

- React Icons: To add icons and enhance usability.

- Git & GitHub: For version control and code storage.
